# mtots_core

Core of the mtots scripting language.
This package should have zero external dependencies.

To start testing it out, you will want `stdlib/` in your
`MTOTS_PATH` variable (so that `__prelude` and other
standard library modules will get picked up), but otherwise,
you can get started with just `cargo run`.

See `samples/` for sample scripts
